Project Description
Click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.  In online advertising, it is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.

Learning objective:
The aim is to understand revenue dynamics in projecting Adwords to customers.
Pre-processing Data: As the size of the dataset is 6GB, we might need to apply some feature selection/reduction techniques.
Understanding various data-mining algorithms for binary classification problems.
Implement Generalized Linear Models (logistic regression and Logistic Regression Model with SGD and L2 regularization)
Comparison of various data-mining models (Using Log-loss and RMSE)
